### What is docker
Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to **package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit** for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.

### Working with docker
#### 1. Creating a Docker file
A file provided to set the instruction for creating a **docker image**
